# Implementation Plan: Spark BLE Batch Firmware Update — Stabilization and Regression Fixes

**Branch**: `plan/001-spark-ble-fw-stabilize` (spec lives on merged `001-spark-ble-fw-stabilize`) | **Date**: 2026-04-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-spark-ble-fw-stabilize/spec.md`

## Summary

Stabilize the Spark (Egicon variant) BLE batch firmware update path post-Phase-3/4 refactor. `SparkBatchUpdateService` already implements the all-or-nothing + abort-on-first-failure control flow at the orchestration layer (`Services/Boot/SparkBatchUpdateService.cs`). The defects are in the layers below: `IBootService` retry bounds, `ConnectionManager` BLE connection-state truthfulness, and `Infrastructure.Protocol/Legacy/BLEManager.cs` resource lifecycle. The technical approach is (1) bootstrap Lean 4 tooling and formalize the boot state machine + BLE lifecycle, (2) introduce FsCheck, derive generators from the Lean state machine, and add property tests on the `net10.0` target, (3) identify the perf-regression root cause by diffing runtime traces against commit `80bf9c6`, (4) land the fixes as a sequence of small vertical PRs — each keyed to one user story or success criterion.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# on .NET 10 (dual TFM `net10.0` + `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`); Lean 4 (toolchain version TBD in Phase 0) for `Lean/`.
**Primary Dependencies**: xUnit 2.5.3 (already in `Tests/Tests.csproj`), FsCheck (new — exact package + version TBD in Phase 0), Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (already used by `SparkBatchUpdateService`), Plugin.BLE via `Infrastructure.Protocol/Legacy/BLEManager.cs`, Lean 4 + mathlib (new).
**Storage**: N/A — the app streams firmware bytes over BLE; no persistent store introduced by this feature.
**Testing**: xUnit for all `Tests/`. FsCheck-derived property tests on `net10.0` for Boot state machine + BLE lifecycle logic that is cross-platform. xUnit `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` integration tests on `net10.0-windows` for code that touches `Infrastructure.Protocol/Legacy/` or WinForms. Manual bench runs (10× close/relaunch, 10× disconnect, 10× upload, 5× timed HMI upload, 10× three-file batch) to validate SC-001..SC-006; a fault-injected harness validates SC-007.
**Target Platform**: Windows 11 desktop (WinForms GUI, WinForms-dependent `net10.0-windows` code) + GitHub Actions Linux (cross-platform `net10.0` code). Reference bench: SPARK-UC SN 2225998 connected via BLE.
**Project Type**: desktop-app (WinForms, single composition root in `GUI.Windows/`, `Core`/`Services`/`Infrastructure.*` libraries).
**Performance Goals**: HMI v8.2 single-file upload mean ≤ 14 min over 5 runs, no single run > 16 min (SC-004). BLE connection-state UI latency ≤ 5 s from physical link loss (FR-002). Upload success rate ≥ 95 % across 10 runs (SC-005).
**Constraints**: Cannot break existing `net10.0-windows` tests (470 tests per CLAUDE.md). Cannot reintroduce `#if TOPLIFT/EDEN/EGICON` (Constitution principle V). Cannot register `ProtocolService` in DI (Domain Constraint: per-channel, created by `ConnectionManager.SwitchToAsync`). `Infrastructure.Protocol/Legacy/` stays `net10.0-windows` only until Phase 5 `Stem.Communication` NuGet migration.
**Scale/Scope**: Single feature, 5 user stories, 10 FRs, 7 SCs. Target ~10 vertical PRs (setup, Lean bootstrap, FsCheck bootstrap, one fix per defect, regression tests, observability, docs).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.0.0). Record a one-line
justification (or N/A) next to each gate; violations must be logged in
*Complexity Tracking* below.

- **I. Pragmatic C#** — PASS. No new interfaces or configuration knobs introduced; the plan reuses `IBootService`, `ICommunicationPort`, `ConnectionManager`, and the existing `SparkBatchUpdateService`. FsCheck is the only new dependency and is testability-driven.
- **II. Correctness-biased defaults** — PASS. All new test code and any fixes land in a codebase already configured with `Nullable=enable`; fixes MUST preserve `CancellationToken` flow and the `Lock` / `Volatile` thread-safety idioms already in place.
- **III. Dual-TFM testing** — PASS. Property tests for the Boot state machine and BLE lifecycle derive from Lean models over pure data — they run on `net10.0` and are exercised by GitHub Actions on Linux. Driver-glue regression tests (BLEManager resource lifecycle) are `net10.0-windows` only and documented as such.
- **IV. Lean 4 formalization (NON-NEGOTIABLE for Core)** — PASS with scope extension. Boot state machine and BLE connection lifecycle are formalized under `Lean/Phase2/`. This is the first Lean work actually committed to the repo — tooling bootstrap (`lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.lean`, mathlib dep) lands as PR #1 of this plan. CLAUDE.md mentioned `Lean/Phase1/` aspirationally; the directory does not exist yet and is created by PR #1.
- **V. Runtime variant selection** — PASS. No `#if` blocks introduced. All fixes stay inside the runtime-variant-selected code path.
- **VI. English-only artifacts** — PASS. Plan, research, data model, quickstart, contracts, Lean sources, XML comments, commit bodies, PR descriptions all in English.
- **Domain Constraints** — PASS. `ProtocolService` stays per-channel and DI-free; `ConnectionManager` remains the sole event-forwarding point; `DictionaryCache` is not touched; `Infrastructure.Protocol/Legacy/` scope is preserved; `ICommunicationPort` pass-through-for-BLE convention is unchanged. Fixes live inside these boundaries, never across them.

**Result**: All gates pass. No complexity to track.

**Structure Decision**: Reuse the existing project layout; add a single new top-level directory `Lean/` for Lean sources. No new .NET projects. Tests grow within existing `Tests/` organized by layer (Unit / Integration). The speckit `specs/` (lowercase) directory remains the authoring home for spec / plan / tasks; the `Lean/` (capital) directory is Lean sources — this matches the convention already declared in `.gitignore` and CLAUDE.md. (Capital-S `Lean/` is the Lean-formalization home per CLAUDE.md; if this double-naming proves confusing on Windows case-insensitive file systems, PR #1 can rename to `Formalization/` before landing.)
